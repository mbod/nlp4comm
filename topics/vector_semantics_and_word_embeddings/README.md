## Vector semantics and word embeddings


* __Vector semantics__ is the mathematical theory of word meaning derived from the linguistic theory known as the __distribution hypotheses__ of meaning, which asserts that similarity between concepts (or word meanings) is a function of shared context.

* __Word embeddings__ are the representation of the distribution patterns of words in multidimensional space.
